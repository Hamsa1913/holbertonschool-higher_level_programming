# 🐍 Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Python Projects Repository**!  
This repository contains multiple Python projects designed to build strong fundamentals in Python programming, starting from basic syntax and gradually progressing into more advanced concepts like data structures, exceptions, and test-driven development.

It is ideal for practice, revision, and showcasing Python skills.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By working through this repository, you will learn how to:

- Use the Python interpreter confidently
- Print text and variables using `print()`
- Work with strings effectively
- Apply indexing and slicing to extract parts of strings
- Follow Python style conventions (PEP 8)
- Validate code quality using `pycodestyle`
- Practice test-driven development using `unittest` and `doctest`

---

## ✅ Requirements

- All scripts must be executable
- The first line of every script must be exactly:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3
- Code must follow PEP 8 standards
🛠️ Usage

Each folder contains Python scripts and (when applicable) test files.

▶️ Running Python scripts

python3 filename.py 

🧪 Running unit tests

python3 -m unittest tests/6-max_integer_test.py

🧾 Running doctests

python3 -m doctest ./tests/5-text_indentation.txt
