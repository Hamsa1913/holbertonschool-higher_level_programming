# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python repository!  
This repo is a collection of Python projects and exercises that helped me build a strong foundation in programming — starting from the basics and moving toward more advanced topics.

Each folder represents a specific stage of learning, focusing on writing clean code, understanding core concepts, and applying best practices such as testing and style guidelines.

---

## 🎯 Key Skills Developed

By completing these projects, I gained experience in:

- Writing clean Python scripts
- Understanding Python fundamentals deeply
- Following coding standards (PEP 8)
- Debugging and handling errors correctly
- Building well-tested programs using TDD
- Improving problem-solving and logical thinking

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3
- All scripts must be executable
- The first line of every script must be:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/python3

```
- Code style must follow PEP 8
- Validation tool: pycodestyle 

## ▶️ How to Run

Run any Python file using: 

```python
python3 filename.py
```

## Run unit tests:
```python
python3 -m unittest tests/6-max_integer_test.py
```
## Run doctests:
```python
python3 -m doctest ./tests/5-text_indentation.txt
```
