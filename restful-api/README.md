# RESTful API Project

## 📖 Introduction
In the modern software world, APIs are the bridge that allows different systems to communicate efficiently.  
This project focuses on **RESTful APIs**, one of the most widely used architectures for building web services.

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of principles that ensures communication is:
- Scalable
- Stateless
- Cacheable
- Easy to integrate across platforms

Through this project, we explore how to **consume APIs**, **build APIs**, **secure them**, and understand how data flows between clients and servers.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn how to:

- Understand **HTTP/HTTPS fundamentals**
- Work with APIs using **command-line tools**
- Consume APIs using **Python**
- Build a simple API using Python’s built-in `http.server`
- Build REST APIs using **Flask**
- Implement **API authentication & security** (Basic Auth + JWT)
- Understand API standards and documentation principles

## ✅ Tasks

### 0. Basics of HTTP/HTTPS
This task focuses on understanding how the web works through HTTP and HTTPS.

#### Key Topics Covered
- Differences between **HTTP vs HTTPS**
- Structure of an HTTP request/response
- Common HTTP methods and their use cases
- Common HTTP status codes and their meanings

#### Example HTTP Methods
- **GET** → Retrieve data
- **POST** → Send data to create a resource
- **PUT** → Update an existing resource
- **DELETE** → Remove a resource

#### Example Status Codes
- **200** → OK (successful request)
- **201** → Created
- **400** → Bad Request
- **401** → Unauthorized
- **404** → Not Found
- **500** → Internal Server Error
